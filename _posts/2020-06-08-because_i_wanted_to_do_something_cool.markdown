#### Or, Why I decided to study Software Engineering.
##### Or, I want to be recession-proof.
###### Or, this internet thing seems to be more than a fad.  


One thread remains in all of the jobs that I have finally recognized.  

Im typically the "computer guy". 

I've been the guy in the next cube over who can figure out why your Excel formula isn't working the way you thought it would.  

I've been the guy who sees you doing the same task 15 times and asks, "Can't this be done quicker by something or even someone else?"

I'm the guy you call instead of IT, because I don't make you feel dumb for forgetting something.

I'm also a guy whose not afraid to learn something new, and to change course in life when needed.  

Software Engineering has always been something that has piqued my interest even as a young teenager.  I remember getting our first family computer that sat in the dining room and learning HTML through building Angelfire and Geocities websites.  (They were dedicated fansites to Saturday Night Live).  

Even when I was in college and decided to go for a degree in Hospitality, I was quickly drawn to hotel systems and excelled in those classes (along with exceling in "Fine Spirits Management")

I enjoyed my time in Hospitality, but would always find myself always looking to how we could improve as a department, asking how we could use systems to increase our guest satisfaction.  

I went to work at corporate headquarters for a major hotel brand and had the opportunity to dive a bit deeper by learning Visual Basic and learning how macros could make repetitive tasks so much easier in my job.

I was also given the opportunity to represent our department to IT, and help in writing new reservation systems by providing use cases.  I always found myself really good at "translating" for our IT team and department to make sure that needs were met.  

When I "changed course", I went to non-profits.  I loved my time there, learning more and more about operations, systems and IT.  I helped through two records system changes, one financial system overhaul and change, and several other projects.  

Now, as 2020 is in "full swing", as I like to call it, I find myself in deep reflection about "what next".  But I keep coming back to the same thing, and that is I have this thread that remains through all of my previous jobs.  I have this genuine curiousity to make my life, business, home, better through development.

I want to help others create great things, by creating great things through Software Engineering.  And thats the great thing about Software Engineering.  It is continually evolving and changing.  What worked 3 or 4 years ago, needs to be made better (unless its COBOL, good luck getting rid of that horcrux).  Im genuinely excited to learn the foundation for something that will always continue to grow and change.

Here. We. Go.
